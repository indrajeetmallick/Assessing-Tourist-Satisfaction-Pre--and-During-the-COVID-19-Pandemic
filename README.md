# Assessing Tourist Satisfaction Pre- and During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Influence of General Safety and Prevention Measures at the Destination

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>R Programming</b> 
- <b>Microsoft Power BI</b>
- <b>Omnibus surveys</b>

<h2>Description of the project</h2>
This project aims to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on tourist satisfaction, with a specific focus on how safety and prevention measures imposed due to the pandemic influenced tourist perceptions during the peak tourist season of 2020 in a mature coastal destination in Catalonia. To achieve this, we conducted interviews (Omnibus survey) in 2019 (n= 1556) and 2020 (n= 2220) with tourists in a north Mediterranean coastal destination of Spain. To execute this research, a two-tiered methodology was employed, combining Explanatory Factor Analysis (EFA) with partial least squares-path modeling (PLS-PM).

<h3>Method 1: Explanatory Factor Analysis (EFA)</h3>
The EFA technique is used to group the attributes effectively, not only to reduce the number of variables under consideration but also to propose relevant destination attribute items that can be categorized into commonly applicable groups.

<h3>Method 2: PLS-PM model</h3>
The latent constructs derived from the EFA are subsequently employed to construct a Partial Least Squares Path Model (PLS-PM) to investigate their influence on tourists' satisfaction,  particularly in the periods before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. PLS-PM stands out as a widely recognized and highly esteemed multivariate technique, setting itself apart from other modeling approaches through its ability to assess both direct and indirect effects within presumed causal relationships.

<h3>Results</h3>

- Perception of health safety significantly influences travel intentions and overall tourist experiences.
- COVID-19 preventive measures did not have a direct impact on tourist satisfaction, they did exhibit an indirect effect, as revealed by the PLS model.
-	The path coefficient of "general safety" in 2020 significantly increased compared to 2019, highlighting the growing importance of feeling safe during the pandemic.
-	Factors contributing to this sense of safety included the public area cleanliness and pedestrian facilities, which gained significance in 2020.
-	These indirect actions generated spillover effects on other aspects of tourist satisfaction, highlighting the need for a balanced approach.
-	Balancing the need for safety with the avoidance of overly invasive preventive measures during health crises, like the COVID-19 pandemic, is a complex challenge for mass tourism destinations.
